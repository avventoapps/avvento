We upgraded to a better online radio streaming platform on 22/Nov/2020 09:30AM EAT and will from time to time greatly improve our programming to include more christian programming for children, family life etc. In a meantime a number of former programs have been archived to create room for better programming and bring new life to the former. Please keep an eye on the Schedule. We apologise for any inconveniences caused, please contact us if any of your former favourite programs have been affected and we will share the programs with you.
Stay tuned into AvventoRadio.
